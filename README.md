# QuantML

QuantML is a collection of Python scripts exploring how machine learning can be applied to quantitative finance.  
The goal is to learn the fundamentals of both fields by starting with simple models and techniques and gradually moving to more complex ones.

## Goals

- Learn the basics of machine learning and quantitative finance  
- Apply machine learning methods to financial data  
- Understand model behavior and performance  
- Build up complexity step by step
  
## Topics

- Basic return and risk calculations  
- Linear regression for price prediction  
- Classification models (logistic, tree-based)  
- Time series forecasting (ARIMA, LSTM)  
- Portfolio optimization and risk management  

## Tools

- Python 3  
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn, Statsmodels  
- PyTorch, TensorFlow
